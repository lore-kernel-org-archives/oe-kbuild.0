Thanks for all the added context. I knew you had forwarded it from the
kbuild team but I wasn't sure who to ask for clarification. Your idea
for a future Fixes-from: tag for this type of thing makes perfect sense.
For now, it seems that if the git log might be used for obtaining
metrics, I should just go ahead and put the Reported-by: tags in. I
really appreciate that you took the time to explain this to me.
